## What is Git Bash?

Git Bash for Windows is simply a package that includes both _Git_ and _Bash_.

Git is an open-source version control system for tracking source code changes when developing software. It keeps a commit history that allows you to revert to a stable state in case you make errors in your code. Git also enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same code base.

Bash is a Unix command-line shell. The name is an acronym for _Bourne-Again Shell_. It comes with useful Unix commands like cat, ssh, SCP, etc., which are not usually found on Windows.
